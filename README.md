# Location-Based-Food-Delivery-Service-in-Python-and-Google-Maps-APIs
Implementation of Location based food delivery service using Python 2.7 and Google Maps APIs. I have implemented the distance of user's selected restaurant from user location and the duration to reach the food and also have drawn the shortest transit path which uses "travelling Salesman Problem" under the hood. It's only the Back-End or just a console app without the database code.
